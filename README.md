# CPP-with-DSA

Welcome to my C++ with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository!

## About

This repository contains my journey of learning C++ programming and mastering various data structures and algorithms. Each folder is dedicated to a specific topic, such as arrays, vectors, stacks, queues, strings, templates, object-oriented programming, and more. The code samples are written to reinforce my understanding of core concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## What I've Learned

- **C++ Basics:** Syntax, variables, control structures, functions, and file I/O.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, vectors, stacks, queues, deques, forward lists, pairs, and priority queues.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, pattern matching, and mathematical sequences (AP, GP).
- **OOP Concepts:** Classes, inheritance, constructors, static and friend members, and virtual functions.
- **Templates:** Function and class templates for generic programming.
- **Exception Handling:** Basic error handling in C++.
- **File Operations:** Reading from and writing to files using streams.
- **Advanced Topics:** Lambda functions, smart pointers, and command-line arguments.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders to find code examples for each topic.
- Each `.cpp` file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.
- Some files include comments explaining the logic and purpose of the code.

## My Experience

Working on this repository has helped me:

- Strengthen my understanding of C++ syntax and features.
- Practice implementing and using various data structures.
- Solve classic algorithmic problems and understand their solutions.
- Learn best practices in code organization and documentation.
- Build confidence in tackling coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.
